# vcmasf
This package implements the one-step and two-step spline fitting with adaptive knots selection for varying coefficient modeling, as well as variable selection method for sparse high dimension problem. More details are in our paper `Varying Coefficient Modeling via Adaptive Spline Fitting`.



## Install the package 'vcmasf'

To install the package from Github, please use

```
`devtools::install_github('wangxf0106/vcmasf')`.
```

## Examples

The R code in `example/example1.R` shows the one-step and two-step fitting methods with adaptive knots selection.

The R code in `example/example2.R` presents the variable selection method for sparse high dimension problem.

The R code in `example/example3.R` applies the two-step fitting method to the COVID-19 case number and environmental factor dataset.
